# Association

Association is a concept in OOP to represent relationship between two/more objects in the system.

Relationship can be categorized in many aspects: form, multiplicity, directional.

There are five forms of relationship:
- Association
    - is a superset of aggregation and composition
    - represents "using" relationship
- Aggregation
    - is a subset of association
    - represents "has-a" relationship
    - is a **weak** association
    - child can exist independently of the parent
- Composition
    - is a subset of association
    - represents "part-of" relationship
    - is a **strong** association
    - child can not exist independently of the parent
- Dependency
- Inheritance

For multiplicity (a.k.a. cardinality) we have:
- one-to-one
- one-to-many
- many-to-many
  
For directional we have:
- Unidirectional
- Bidirectional
